MLflow Docker Flask

MLflow Docker Flask is a template repository for deploying machine learning models using MLflow, Docker, and Flask. This repository provides a simple yet robust structure to containerize and deploy your MLflow models with a Flask API for easy integration into your applications.

Getting Started
Clone the Repository: Begin by cloning this repository to your local machine.

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/mlflow-docker-flask.git
Install Dependencies: Navigate into the cloned directory and install the necessary dependencies.

bash
Copy code
cd mlflow-docker-flask
pip install -r requirements.txt
Build Docker Image: Build the Docker image using the provided Dockerfile.

bash
Copy code
docker build -t mlflow-docker-flask .
Run Docker Container: Once the Docker image is built, run the container.

bash
Copy code
docker run -p 5000:5000 mlflow-docker-flask
Access the API: The Flask API will be accessible at http://localhost:5000.

Structure
app.py: Defines the Flask application and API endpoints.
mlflow_server.py: Script to start the MLflow server.
model.py: Example model script for inference.
Dockerfile: Docker configuration file to build the container.
requirements.txt: List of Python dependencies.
models/: Directory to store MLflow model artifacts.
data/: Directory to store data or training artifacts.
Customization
Model Deployment: Replace the example model in model.py with your trained ML model.
Additional Endpoints: Modify app.py to add or modify API endpoints as needed.
Dependencies: Update requirements.txt with any additional Python dependencies required for your project.
